Scripts for playing on the KGS Go Server

To start matilda, edit the configuration files (casual or tournament) and obtain
the latest version of kgsGTP, from https://www.gokgs.com/download.jsp.

To prevent timeouts the network latency compensation settings should be set
accordingly, in the matilda configuration (src/config.h).
