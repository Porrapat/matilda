Matilda application with GTP interface

Attempts to understand when to perform internal maintenance; see the help for
more information. Besides the standard GTP commands it also supports commands
that allow exporting SGF files, perform maintenance on-demand, etc.
Run list-commands or help for more information.

With a whole-game context it also performs time control adjustments, prevents
positional superkos, performs maintenance and thinking between turns, etc. This
under the assumption the program is playing as one of the players only; which is
enabled at startup.
