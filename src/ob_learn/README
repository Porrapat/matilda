Application for the generation of openings books using MCTS


Program for the evaluation of positions from game records and the calculation of
opening book rules. All positions before a pass or capture are extracted from
the game record files, sorted by number of occurrences, and MCTS is used to
determine the best response play.

It reads .sgf files in the data directory and produces a unique .ob file in the
same directory.
