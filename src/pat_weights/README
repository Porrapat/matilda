Simple application for grading 3x3 patterns by frequency of selection in SGF
records. The results are printed to data/NxN.weights.

The purpose of these weights is probability selection over a 3x3 neighborhood
around the last play; not over the whole board.

The weights are 16-bit values that are later scaled by a factor of 1/9 so their
maximum total fits 16 bits.
