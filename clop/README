This directory contains the files used for parameter optimization using CLOP --
Confident Local Optimization for Noisy Black-Box parameter tuning, available:
http://www.remi-coulom.fr/CLOP/

If you want to contribute computation time to Matilda, this is a great way to
do so.

How to optimize with CLOP.

1. Download CLOP from http://www.remi-coulom.fr/CLOP/
2. Compile the CLI or GUI version of it.
3. Install python and GNU Go (or other GTP comparison opponent of your choice)
4. Compile matilda and update the file goguiscript.py with the correct file
    path.
5. If your system can't interpret the goguiscript.py autommatically as Python
    you may need to edit the source code of CLOP to accept several parameters.
6. Edit the file config.clop with what parameters you want to optimize.
7. Open CLOP, load config.clop and watch it go.
