Program for the evaluation of positions from game records and the production of
a state->play file (.spb), to be used for further play suggestions besides
(Fuego-style) opening books.

.spb files contain the complete description of the board contents, ignoring ko,
and the suggested play by black. In contrast Fuego-style opening books cannot
represent positions unreachable by alternate play (like those after a capture,
or from handicap games).

States after the capture of single stones are ignored, so ko doesn't have to be
tested. This should seldom have any impact.

The program reads SGF files and goes through the most common game states. For
each it calculates the optimal play and stores it in output.spb, unless the
state is already found in previous .ob or .spb files of the data directory.
