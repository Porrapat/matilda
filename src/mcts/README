Heuristic UCT-RAVE implementation.

With RAVE and criticality.
Playout is limited with dynamic offset depending on stone count.
Cutoff playouts are rated. Playouts	are cut short with a mercy threshold (like
pachi, orego and others). Initilizes expanded states with prior values.
Last-good-reply with forgetting (LGRF1) is also used. A virtual loss is also
added on play traversion, that is later corrected if needed.

MCTS can be resumed on demand by a few extra simulations at a time.
It can also record the average final score, for the purpose of score estimation.
