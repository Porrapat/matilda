Matilda is presently run as standalone executables, with no installation
required or supported. It is currently aimed at Linux and BSD systems. If it
fails to compile or run in these systems please open an issue. It should also be
Mac OS X compatible, but it is difficult to guarantee it at this time. If you
use Xcode you may need to install a compiler by the side, since the branch of
llvm in Xcode does not support OpenMP.

You are advised to review the contents of the file src/inc/matilda.h for your
system. Remember to edit the line

#define UCT_MEMORY 512

with the amount of memory (in MiB) that Matilda can use for MCTS.

Other settings may also be configured for testing by mistake, so please
understand what each setting does and set them correctly. When ready, execute

make

You should now have an executable file named matilda, that is the main program.

To test the good behaviour of the program in the current system you can also run
the executable named test.

For short instructions on how to use each program run them with --help.

If you need to recompile Matilda you are advised to run

make clean

make

Because for now header file changes are not detected automatically.

All external files reside in the folder data/. Files produced by Matilda will
also be produced to this folder only. Please notice that Matilda enforces its
external file dependencies. If it is expecting a file to be found it has to be
provided or the program will close. If you do not have opening books you can
disable their use with the switch --disable_opening_books.

Matilda will expect to find the data/ folder in the current working directory,
that by default is that of the parent process. Because of this, you may need to
create a link to data/ in the current directory, or use the switch --data
<folder> to override the directory path.
