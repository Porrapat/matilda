Simple application for grading 3x3 patterns by frequency of selection in SGF
records. The results are written to data/NxN.weights.new.

The number of appearances is not normalized. If a pattern appears multiple times
it will be selected as winner or loser multiple times. In contrast with
considering only unique patterns per state, this does not privilege patterns
that are more common.

The weights are 16-bit values that are later scaled by a factor of 1/9 so their
maximum total on a 3x3 neighborship fits 16 bits.
