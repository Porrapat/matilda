Application for the compilation of an openings book


This application reads a collection of SGF files and generates a
text/Fuego-style opening book file (.ob).

Please avoid feeding SGF files of the wrong board size, ruleset, etc since the
application might not be able to catch all possible exceptions. SGF files in
unicode might also produce erroneous results, though this has not been observed
yet. If you have problems send me a copy of the faulty file and the version
number you are using.

The opening book is ruleset agnostic. It also ignores matches started with
handicap stones. The rules themselves have a minimum of occurrences. States
after the capture of single stones are ignored, so ko doesn't have to be tested.
This should seldom have any impact.
