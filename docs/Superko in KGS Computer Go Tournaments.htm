<h1>Superko in KGS Computer Go Tournaments</h1>

<p>
In over a thousand games played in computer Go tournaments on KGS, ten 
have been ended by the Superko rule. In four of these ten cases, the 
effect of the rule effectively decided the result of the game.
</p>

<h3>Forms of Superko rule.</h3>

<p>
There are four forms of superko rule:
</p><p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>PSK
<td><b>P</b>ositional <b>S</b>uper<b>K</b>o<td>
A player may not play a stone so as to create a previous board which
existed previously in the game.
<td>
Creation refers to the position just after the play and consequent removals.
<tr><th>SSK
<td><b>S</b>ituational <b>S</b>uper<b>K</b>o<td>
A player may not play a stone so as to create a board position which
existed previously in the game, and in which it was the opponent's turn to move next.
<td>
Creation refers to the position just after the play and consequent
removals, and the rule also takes account of who moves next.
<tr><th>NSK
<td><b>N</b>atural <b>S</b>ituational Super<b>K</b>o<td>
A player may not play a stone so as to create a board position which
existed previously in the game, if s/he played to create it previously.
<td>
Creation refers to the position just after the play and consequent removals.
<tr><th>ChSK
<td><b>Ch</b>inese <b>S</b>ituational Super<b>K</b>o<td>
A play may not recreate a previous board position from the game by means of 
basic ko or sending-2-returning-1. If a cycle arises in another way and neither 
player varies from it, the referee may declare a draw or require a replay. 
<td>
This, according to the sixth meeting of the International Go Rules Forum, is 
what the Chinese rules were intended to specify. 
</table>

</p><p>
All forms of superko rule refer only to playing of stones. <b>It is always legal 
to pass</b>, whatever form of the rule may apply.
</p>

<h3>Chinese Rules of Go, as on KGS</h3>

<p>
Computer Go tournaments on KGS have so far always used "Chinese Rules", as 
implemented on KGS.
</p><p>

<div style="background: #FFFFBB"></div>
At the time the superko code on KGS was implemented, the intention of the 
Chinese Rules of Go about repeated positions was unclear. Section 6, as 
translated into English in "<i>The Go Player's Almanac</i>", Richard Bozulich, 
1992, reads in full:
<div class=quote>
Reappearance of the same board position is forbidden throughout the game.</div>
However, section 20.3 reads:
<div class=quote>
3. In rare situations such as triple ko, quadruple ko, eternal life, and 
round-robin ko, if neither side will yield, the referee may declare a draw 
or replay.</div>
These two sections are in contradiction. The implementers of <b class=emp>KGS</b> 
resolved this by giving priority to the section which appears first, and 
<b class=emp>implemented Positional Superko</b>.
</p>

<h3>Superko incidents in KGS Computer Go tournaments</h3>

<p>
The application of the Positional Superko rule has several times affected a computer Go 
tournament game on KGS. These incidents have all be mentioned on the reports of the event, 
and are listed below.

</table><br>
Most of these positions involved the 
<a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?SendingTwoReturningOne">sending two, returning one</a> 
shape. None of those would have been forbidden by Situational Superko or by 
Natural Situational Superko.
